This macro workflow is detailed in "Apoptosis quantification in tissue: development of a semi automatic protocol and assessment of critical steps of image processing"

# Prerequisites:
CASQITO runs on Fiji and only treat .lif files of stacks images.

# Install & Launch:
1. Download CASQITO macro
2. Start Fiji
3. On Fiji, follow "Plugins" > "Macro" > "Run" find and select "CASQITO.ijm" file. Alternatively, drag and drop "CASQITO.ijm" file on Fiji and click "run".
4. Follow the instructions step by step. 

# Outputs: 
CASQITO can output up to 4 types of files
